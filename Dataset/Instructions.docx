Case Study 1:

The files in the above link: Order1.csv and Order2.csv shows different orders placed on an ecommerce website, the amount of the purchase, any discount provided and order status.

Schema:

Table Name: Order1

OrderId: Order's id 
OrderItemId: Item ids of the purchase orders.
QuantityOrdered: Number of items Ordered for an order.
ItemPrice: Order total value
PromotionDiscount: Discount of an Order.
batch_id: Batch id of the order. (Note: Use the last one to fetch out the correct metrics of an order).

Table Name: Order2

OrderId: Order's id 
Purchasedate: Order date of a Purchase.
OrderStatus: Status of an order.
batch_id: Batch id of the order. (Note: Use the last one to fetch out the correct metrics of an order).


Write SQL queries to determine:

Q1. Calculate the Total order quantity, GMV and Net sales, where GMV is the summation of all the order values, and Net sale is the values after the discount.

Q2. Calculate Total order quantity, GMV and Net sales for the month of October 2022 where the order status is not equal to "Canceled".
Case Study 2:

The files in the above link: User1.csv and User2.csv shows user behavior data of a mobile app. 

Schema:

Table Name: User1

user_id: Unique Id of a user.
country: Country where the users installed the app.
Platform: Mobile platform the users use to operate the app. 
user_first_seen_date: Date of installing the app.

Table Name: User2

user_id: Unique Id of a user.
Date: Date on which the user was using the app. 
sessionID: Id of a session (30 min. of activity counts as one session for a user.) 

Write SQL queries to determine:

Q1. Find the 3-day, 7-day and overall running sum of the number of unique sessions every day for every “country” and “platform”.
Q2. Average number of days users use the app.
Q3. Retention percentage for Day-1, Day-3 and Day-7.
  
Retention is defined as the action when a user comes back to the platform, where Day 0 is the install date and subsequently, Day 1 is the date after the install date, and so on. 

For Ex., if the users install the app on 1st July, then Day 1 will be 2nd July, and Day 30 will be 31st July.
